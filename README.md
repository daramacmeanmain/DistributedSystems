# Distributed Systems Project - Asynchronous RMI Dictionary Service
This is my submission for the Distibuted Systems project. To run, open the project in JEE, right click DictionaryServiceSetup.java --> Run As --> Run on Server. The console will display a ready message. The data from the dictionary can then be displayed to the console by running the DSServlet class. 

dsHome.jsp was intended to search the dictionary, but currently just returns the user query.
